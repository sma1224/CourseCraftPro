Build a comprehensive Course Creation Suite - a professional SaaS web application that transforms how educators, trainers, and instructional designers create courses. This should be a production-ready platform that educational institutions and corporate training departments would subscribe to and use daily.
Application Vision
Create a unified platform called "Course Creation Suite" that guides users through the complete course development workflow: outline creation → content development → video production → assessment building → resource management → final export and publishing. The platform should feel premium, intuitive, and powerful enough to handle enterprise-level course development.
Core User Experience
Target Users:

University professors creating online courses
Corporate trainers developing employee education programs
Independent educators building course content for sale
Instructional designers working for educational institutions

Primary Value Proposition:
Transform weeks of manual course development into hours of AI-assisted creation, while maintaining quality and pedagogical best practices.
Intelligent User Experience Flow
Course Creation Workflow:

Initial Prompt Entry: User describes their course idea in natural language in a free-form text area
AI Analysis: System analyzes the prompt and extracts available information about the course
Information Assessment: AI identifies what information is missing or needs clarification
Interactive Clarification: System asks follow-up questions via chat or voice to gather missing details
Confirmation: User reviews all gathered information before outline generation
AI Generation: System creates comprehensive course outline based on complete information
Review and Refinement: User can edit, regenerate sections, or ask for modifications

Conversation Examples:
User Input: "I want to teach people about social media marketing"
AI Response: "Great! I can help you create a social media marketing course. Let me ask a few questions to make this perfect for your needs:

Who is your target audience? (Complete beginners, small business owners, marketing professionals?)
How much time do you have for this course?
Do you want to focus on specific platforms like Facebook and Instagram, or cover all major platforms?
Should this be more theoretical knowledge or hands-on practice?

Would you prefer to continue via chat or switch to voice conversation?"
Advanced Example:
User Input: "Create a comprehensive digital transformation workshop for mid-level managers in traditional manufacturing companies who need to understand how AI and IoT can improve their operations, should be 2 days with practical exercises"
AI Response: "Excellent! You've provided great detail. I have most of what I need:
✓ Target audience: Mid-level managers in manufacturing
✓ Topic: Digital transformation with AI and IoT focus
✓ Duration: 2 days
✓ Format: Workshop with practical exercises
Just a couple of clarifications:

What's the technical background of these managers?
Do you want to include specific AI/IoT vendors or keep it vendor-neutral?
Should I include ROI calculation methods for digital transformation projects?"
